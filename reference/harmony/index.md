# Harmony

Harmony is what we add to melody to fill pieces of music out - think of what the other fingers of a pianists hand is doing, apart from playing the melody. Or how about an orchestra - not everybody plays the tune all the time!

Harmony is a big part of what gives music its 'feel', and in some types of music is more important than the melody - if there even is one!
