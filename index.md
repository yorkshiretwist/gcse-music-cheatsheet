# Welcome

Welcome to this cheatsheet for GCSE music, specifically the AQA GCSE music course (8271). No copyright infingement is intended, this site is here to help my son revise for his GCSE music course.

GCSE music covers three main areas:

- <a href="/understand/">Understanding music</a>
- <a href="/perform/">Performing music</a>
- <a href="/compose/">Composing music</a>

Each of these areas is related. For example, it will help you understand music if you can perform it to some degree. It will help you compose interesting music if you can understand what you're doing! And an appreciation of music of different ages and genres - even stuff you don't 'like' - will help make you a more rounded musician.

There's also a huge <a href="./reference/">reference section</a> in this site.
