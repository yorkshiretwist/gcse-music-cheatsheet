# Understanding music

Your understanding of music is assessed in a 1 hour 30 minute exam where you listen to music and answer questions on it. This exam is worth 96 marks - or 40% of your GCSE mark. There are two sections:

## Section A: Listening to unfamiliar music (68 marks)

You'll listen to music from these four areas:

1. Western classical tradition 1650-1910
2. Popular music
3. Traditional music
4. Western classical tradition since 1910

## B: Study pieces (28 marks)

You must study one piece from the Western classical tradition 1650-1910, and one piece from any of the other 3 areas above.

You'll need to know about:

- The effect of audience, time and place on how the study pieces were created, developed and performed
- How and why the music across the areas you choose has changed over time
- How the composer's purpose and intention for the music is reflected in their use of musical elements
- The relevant musical vocabulary and terminology for the pieces you study
